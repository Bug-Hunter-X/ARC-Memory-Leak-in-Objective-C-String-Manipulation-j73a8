The solution lies in explicitly managing the returned object's lifecycle, ensuring it is retained by the caller or that a copy is created that is independent of the scope of the original method:

**Solution 1: Caller retains the object:**

```objectivec
- (NSString *)processString:(NSString *)inputString {
    NSString *modifiedString = [inputString stringByAppendingString:@"_modified"];
    return modifiedString; // Caller must retain this object
}

// In the calling method:
NSString *result = [[self processString:myString] retain]; //Retain the object!
[result release]; //Later, remember to release it
```

**Solution 2 (Recommended):  Return a copy:**

```objectivec
- (NSString *)processString:(NSString *)inputString {
    NSString *modifiedString = [inputString stringByAppendingString:@"_modified"];
    return [modifiedString copy]; // Creates a new, independent copy
}

// No need for explicit retain/release in caller
NSString *result = [self processString:myString];
```
The second solution using `copy` is generally preferred as it avoids the need for manual memory management by the caller, thereby reducing the risk of memory leaks and making the code cleaner.
